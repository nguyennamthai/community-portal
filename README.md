# community-portal

This is my toy project using the latest version of Spring Boot. It's basically a portal for a community where members can post their messages. These messages can be edited and deleted by the admin only.  
Technologies in use:  
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* Spring Security
* Spring Data
* Spring AOP
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap 4

This project isn't entirely complete yet, but the functionality has been there. You can run tests by cloning the repository and execute `mvn test`.  
Note that the project makes use of Project Lombok, you need to have its plugin in your IDE then.
